# Adventure-Game
A Text-based old-fashioned text-based adventure game. It is my first run with Python.

## General Description:
The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time. 
E.g. The enemy is randomly picked from a list of enemies.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

## Requirements:
You need Python version 3.6 or later installed.

## How to play:
Download game.py and functions.py in a folder on your computer.
Open this folder in a terminal, and just type:
`python game.py` or `python3 game.py` depending on yourPython installation.
And enjoy!
